# v2.0

## v2.0.1
Another implementation as comparison with v2.0

## v2.0.2
detach gradient of the output of the 1st encoder.

## v2.0.3
detach gradient of query for the extra decoder. It results in gradient of all inputs to the extra decoder are detached.



# v2.2
Extra decoder has its own queries embedding.

# v2.3
Extra decoder has its own queries positional embedding.

# v2.4
Based on v2.3, extra decoder share parameters with the 1st decoder.

# v2.5

## v2.5.1
Another implementation of v2.5


# v2.6


# v2.7
Apply two-stage scheme on both first and last encoder layers.



# v2.8
Supplant the 1st encoder layer with MultiScaleSampler (v1.4 1 head)


# v2.9
On the basis of v2.5, apply two-stage scheme on both first and last encoder layers.

first encoder layer and last encoder layer has their own parameter for proposal generation.

## v2.9.1
Try to infuse the idea of iterative refinement into the two-stage proposal generation.

Proposals generated by the first encoder layer will be updated by first decoder layer. The updated proposals could serve as better anchors for the two-stage proposal generation of last encoder layer.




# v3.0
Naive cascade struture, but with new life!
